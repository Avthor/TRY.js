![Google Drive™](/drive_outline-small.png?raw=true "Google Drive™")


TRY.js is a deliberately rudimentary held programming language to facilitate entry into the algorithms. It is supposed to programm a virtual robot which moves in a 3D environment able to pick up and unload objects. The program gives beginners a first insight into the world of computer programming.

Due to the ease of use and the limited instruction set TRY.js is well suited for the introduction to programming, especially for learning the programming language JavaScript.

TRY.js gives an overview about synchronious and asynchronious codes as well as test driven development.

To use the TRY.js code editor you need a [Google™ account](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp "Create your Google Account"). All you work will be saved on [Google Drive™](https://drive.google.com) where you can share your work with your friends. To share your work with the world wide web visit [channel.try.js](https://github.com/s-a/channel.try.js) and follow the instructions.

So far this web app is developed and tested with Google Chrome. Anyway you are welcome to send possible [bug reports](https://github.com/s-a/try.js/issues) and/or [fixes](https://github.com/s-a/try.js).

### Load example presets and the way to share your work on GitHub
A click on the ```Package / Open``` menu item will show a list of avilable examples.
Visit https://github.com/s-a/channel.try.js for more information.

### [Environment API](/docs/environment.MD) - Create and edit your own environments
A click on the ```Environment``` menu item will open an editor with a property editor to change the current environment meta data. In this view you do not need to write code manually. Simply press `Document / New` to assign current environment meta data to code window. One of many examples [basic-environment.json](https://github.com/s-a/examples.try.js/blob/master/first%20steps/basic-environment.json).


### [Robot API](/docs/robot.MD) - Create and edit your own robot programs
A click on the ```Program / Edit``` menu item will open an editor. Simply press ```Document / New``` to assign current robot program code to code window. After writing your code you need to click on ```AssignCode``` menu item. This will load your current program into the robot. One of many examples [basic-program.js](https://github.com/s-a/examples.try.js/blob/master/first%20steps/basic-program.js).  


### [Test API](/docs/tests.MD) - Create and edit tests
A click on the ```Tests / Edit``` menu item will open an editor. Simply press ```Document / New``` to assign current test suite code to code window. After writing your code you need to click on ```AssignCode``` menu item. This will load your current tests into the environment. One of many examples [basic-tests.js](https://github.com/s-a/examples.try.js/blob/master/first%20steps/basic-tests.js).
