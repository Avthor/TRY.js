[TRY.js](http://s-a.github.io/TRY.js/) is supposed to programm a virtual robot which moves in a 3D environment able to pick up and unload objects. The program gives beginners a first insight into the world of computer programming.

Due to the ease of use and the limited [instruction set](https://github.com/s-a/TRY.js/blob/development/docs/robot.MD) [TRY.js](http://s-a.github.io/TRY.js/) is well suited for the introduction to programming, especially for learning the programming language JavaScript. It gives an overview about [synchronious and asynchronious codes](https://github.com/s-a/TRY.js/blob/development/docs/robot.MD) as well as [test driven development](/docs/tests.MD).  

Anyway you are welcome to send possible [bug reports](https://github.com/s-a/try.js/issues) and/or [fixes](https://github.com/s-a/try.js).  

***Share your work***  
All your work can be saved on [Google Drive™](https://drive.google.com) where you can share your work with your friends. You need a [Google™ account](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp "Create your Google Account") to use this feature. However this is optional. You can easily quick share something with a click on the ```Package / ShareViaLink``` menu item. This will load a new window where you can copy the URL to share.  

To publish your work world wide visit [channel.try.js](https://github.com/s-a/channel.try.js) and follow the instructions. The channel.json points to different codes in external repositories. There are some packages available containing an environment, a test suite and a robot program for demonstration purposes. A robot program is optional so you can create different levels for TRY.js. I would be happy to see various mutations and receive pull requests there. If you do not want create your own repo create your own folder and add your codes to [examples.try.js](https://github.com/s-a/examples.try.js).

### Improve the code
Forks are welcome but please create a new branch. There is a client side test method available ```window.engine.test();```. The method should be invoked via console and tests all packages from [channel.try.js](https://github.com/s-a/channel.try.js) in one suite. This should help to keep the code stable.
