# TRY.js (Beta)

![Google Drive™](/drive_outline-small.png?raw=true "Google Drive™")


TRY.js is supposed to programm a virtual robot which moves in a 3D environment able to pick up and unload objects. The program gives beginners a first insight into the world of computer programming.

Due to the ease of use and the limited instruction set TRY.js is well suited for the introduction to programming, especially for learning the programming language JavaScript. It gives an overview about [synchronious and asynchronious codes](https://github.com/s-a/TRY.js/blob/development/docs/robot.MD) as well as [test driven development](/docs/tests.MD).  

So far this web app is developed and ***tested with Google Chrome***. Anyway you are welcome to send possible [bug reports](https://github.com/s-a/try.js/issues) and/or [fixes](https://github.com/s-a/try.js).  

***Share your work***  
All your work can be saved on [Google Drive™](https://drive.google.com) where you can share your work with your friends. You need a [Google™ account](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp "Create your Google Account") to use this feature. However this is optional. You can easily quick share something with a click on the ```Package / ShareViaLink``` menu item. This will load a new window where you can copy the URL to share.  

To publish your work world wide visit [channel.try.js](https://github.com/s-a/channel.try.js) and follow the instructions. The channel.json points to different codes in external repositories. There are some packages available containg an environment, a test suite and a robot program for demonstration purposes. A robot program is optional so you can create different levels for TRY.js. I would be happy to see various mutations and receive pull requests there. If you do not want create your repo add your codes to [examples.try.js](https://github.com/s-a/examples.try.js).

### Improve the code
Forks are welcome but please create a new branch. There is a client side test method available ```engine.test();```. The method tests all packages from [channel.try.js](https://github.com/s-a/channel.try.js). This should help to keep the code stable.
